#Origins of Linux & Unix
- In 1969-1970, Kenneth Thompson and others at AT&T Bell Labs began developing a small operating system PDP-7, also known as Unix. 
- In 1972-1973 the system was rewritten in the programming language C.
- AT&T continued developing Unix under the names “System III” and later “System V".
- Soon, there was many different versions of Unix.
- In 1984 Richard Stallman’s Free Software Foundation (FSF) began a project after which, the software could be freely used, read, modified, and redistributed. The FSF successfully built a vast number of useful components, including a C compiler (gcc), an impressive text editor (emacs), and a host of fundamental tools.
- In 1991 Linus Torvalds began developing an operating system, which he named “Linux” . This was known as a freely-modifiable and very useful operating system. 
- This is an example of a Linux-based system:

 - The LINUX system has a few commands which are listed here:
