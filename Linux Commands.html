<h1> Common Commands </h1>

<p> The following are a few LINUX Commands</p>
<ol>
        <li>pwd - print working directory </li>
    <li>mkdir - make directory </li>
    <li> cd-change directory</li>
    <li> ls-list files
        <li> cp= copy files/folder(s)</li>
    <li> mv - move/rename files/folders </li>
    <li> rm - delete files/folders</li>
    <li> cat = catenate (concatenate) - reads one or more files and prints them.</li>
    <li> chmod- change file`s access permissions(r,w,o)</li>
    <li> chown- change owner of file</li>
</ol>

        <p> The following pictures differentiate the commands, "chmod" and "chown"</p>

<p> After inputting commands and/or instructions, a VI editor would be very helpful
    The VI editor makes it easier to navigate the words and/or lines. It would also facilitate navugating the screen!</p>
<p> A few examples are:</p>
<ol>
    <li> arrow keys: left and right</li>
    <li> w: move forward one word</li>
    <li> hi: move to the top of the screen</li>

</ol>

<p> If you want to learn more tools available with the VI editor, watch the video linked below</p>

<p> Now, when exchanging information between two computers, it is important to transfer the files and/or information in a secure way.
This is possible by using protocols such as SSH, FTP, or FTPS. Though they may seem familiar, there are a few differences.
    - First, unlike FTP and FTPS, SSH uses "public key encryption" for its security. SSH is used hand-in-hand with a VPN connection. SSH is available for all OS systems. However, SSH is not a
    default system for file transfers.
    - Instead, FTP is used for file transfers. This "protocol" is used because it complies with other protocols. Unlike the port for SSH, the port for
    FTP is 21.
    - A similar protocol to FTP is SFTP. It is almost like FTP, but more secure as the name "Secure File Transfer Protocol", implies.
    Another difference is the port, which, for SFTP is 22 instead of 21.

<p> Here are some pictures showing the connection to SSH vs SFTP</p>
