<h1> How does the Internet work? </h1>
<p>In this tutorial we will talk about DNS, IP, Domain Names,Top level domain names(TLD), how to read a web address,SSL secure website browsing through HTTPS over port 443 and HTTP over port 80, REST and Roy Fielding's dissertation.</p>
    <dl> 1. Laptop and computer is connected to the Wifi which is connected to Internet service provider (ISP) which will be able to connected to multiple networks globally.</dl>
<dl>a. Protocol: a well known set of rules and standards used to communicate between machines. </dl>
<dl>2. Every device on the internet in the world have a unique address called Internet Protocol  address.</dl>
<dl>a. The IP address is just an a number and it it similar like a home address.</dl>
<dl>b.The IP address would be represented in bits. </dl>
<dl>c. Traditional IP address are 32 bits long with 8 bits from each part which are called IPV4.</dl>
<dl>d. Traditional hierarchy IP: country network, region network, subnetwork, device.</dl>
<dl>e. In IPV6: It is a multi year which has 128 bits which provides 340 undecillion unique address.</dl>
<dl>3. To visit a website one  device is asking another device for information. One device will send its IP address then receive its origin address so it would easier for the devices to understand where to send their information. </dl>
  <dl>a. For example, I will type up facebook.com and the DNS will find the correct IP address to the destination address.</dl>
    <dl>4. DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy which can be separated into major domain names (.org, .com, .net) which will be easier to locate the IP address. </dl>
  <dl>5. You need to be careful of DNS spoofing which is when a hacker types into the DNS server and changes to match the main name with the wrong IP address and this will make you regard a fake website.</dl>
